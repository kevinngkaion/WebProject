#COSC 213 Final Project

This website is a sports camp management system that shows teachers and admin information on students currently participating in the program.

The user can choose to log-in or to register for a new account. This account will be a parent account. From here, the parent can add children to their account. Parents can only add children and view their children.

Once a registration is submitted for a student, the admin can view and approve the registrations. Admin can also change the status of a student in order to renew their registration or remove them from the registration list. Admin can also create new accounts for students and coaches. Creating an account this way auto-generates a username and password for the user.

The system controls access to user information depending on access level.
